The final project has huge size because of the dataset I was working on. 
These datasets were in data folder and I deleted the whole folder to shrink the project size. 
But don't worry, if you want to have those datasets and folder back, you just need to take your time, executing my jupyter notebook file, then you'll have all needed files.
